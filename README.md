# CSC8370ProjectDemo

âš¡ If you can run "FirstLesson.py" on your PC, then congratulations, you have mastered the knowledge of this lesson.

âš¡ If you have no idea how to Configure the operating environment to run this .py file,
following me to talk about how to run it in the server.

### connecting to server using VScode by SSH
* Open SSH config File, and enter the following up:

      Host CSc8370
  
        HostName inspire-gpu.cs.gsu.edu
  
        Port 2220-2224
  
        User gpu1

* Input password, then try to remote connecting

### We first enter the folder '/user1' if we are in the folder '/home'
    cd user1

### Creating a new environment for project model

* we have to input this command firstly, since the virtual environment is build by nvidia docker.(Any other cases, We dont need this step)
```
Source .bashrc
```
* Using **conda** command to check the environment we have built.
```
conda env list
```
* Using **conda** command to build a new environment for our project.
```
conda create -n your_env_name python=X.X.X
```
for example: conda create -n dong_test python=3.8.19
* Activating the new environment by using **conda** command (ImportantðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ)
```
conda activate dong_test
```

### Upload the code using git command [We can also choose file transfer(SSH) to upload the code ourselves.]

* Creating a new folder 'user1' to save ours code
